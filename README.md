# glitter-pentest
Project in magshimim program, Check for vulnerabilities and exploit weaknesses (Penetration test)
The site is designed for weakness testing (the site isnt working all the year, only when the students uses them for project)
The site called glitter.org.il, and its an a fake social media site
I made an docx file to document each entry point and collect the weak points
Also made a swiss knife that demonstrates any hack or gap i find
The knife has 15 options of different weakness i find 
All the functions and files is programed in python
